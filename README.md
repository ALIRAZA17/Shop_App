# Shop_App
This is The Ecommerce Shop App built using Flutter and Providers for State Management

## Description
This App mainly focuses on the State Management using Providers.

## Providers
The provider package is an easy to use package which is basically a wrapper around the InheritedWidgets that makes it easier to use and manage. It provides a state management technique that is used for managing a piece of data around the app.

The Class that I used for this purpose is ChangeNotifierProvider which notifies every widget(listening to that change) about the changes occuring in the App during its running.
