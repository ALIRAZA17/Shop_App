# shop_app

This is my new flutter project Shop Application which uses the concept of State Management and Providers

## Getting Started

The provider package is an easy to use package which is basically a wrapper around the InheritedWidgets that makes it easier to use and manage. It provides a state management technique that is used for managing a piece of data around the app.

The Class that I used in it is ChangeNotifierProvider which notify every widget(which listens to these changes) about the changes that happened during the running of Application
